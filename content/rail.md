Title: Something about rail

I find railways fascinating preceisely because most people don't. Railways are
immensely complicated systems, with immense logistic challenges and problems to
overcome, yet we ride on them without noticing any of it. They are shaped by
politics and economics, and in turn they shape politics and economics. They
take us to the places we want to go, but they often made those places to begin
with. I'd like to show you through a cross section of these amazing systems by
exploring the deep and complex reasons why America lacks high speed rail.

The simple explanation most people give, which betrays immediately that they
have not thought deeply on the subject, is that America simply isn't dense
enough to support it, ignoring that even dense regions lack it (though there is
still some truth). Those who have looked more deeply will see freight rail
interference and politicking, but tend to see these as primarily contemporary
problems, rather than significantly historical.
