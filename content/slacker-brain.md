Title: My brain on Slack
Date: 2017-3-4 00:12:00

It might seem, at first glance, like Slack would be the absolute worst thing
for someone with ADHD, like me. It's not like I need anything else to distract
me; my brain does that just fine all on its own. And yet, I find it (and
HipChat and IRC and the like) are indispensible for me. Since I'm currently
in a plane 33,000 feet over the Atlantic and unable to sleep, I'm going to do a
little public introspection, and think about why that is.

My attention jumps around when I work. Sometimes I can get "in the zone", and
be practically immune from distraction, but it's rare.  And, failing that, my
focus will wander. It's just how my brain works. I've found that chat systems
enable me to harness that wandering to productive ends. If my focus is going to
jump, why not provide it a productive place to land? Rather than watching the
river float by out the window, or playing my current favorite song (Haunting,
Haunted, Haunts by Against Me, at the moment) over in my head, or pondering
subway track configurations (I'm a nerd sue me), I can do something valuable. I
can help someone, or learn something, or build a relationship with coworkers.

Moreover, I find it *far* easier to communicate via text than voice. If my
focus drifts in vocal conversation, even for a second, I lose information and
context. In chat, the entire conversation is there for me to replay. blah blah

something something vocal dysphoria social anxiety.
