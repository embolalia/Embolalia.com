People occasionally ask where the name Embolalia came from. Occasionally,
someone recognizes the word, defined above. But why did I pick this obscure
word as the username I use nearly everywhere?

It goes back to when I was playing a game called
[NationStates](http://nationstates.net). In the game, you create a country, and
play around with its policies. There's also a World Assembly (which used to be
called the United Nations until the real UN
[sent a cease and desist](http://www.maxbarry.com/2008/04/02/news.html)), in
which you propose and vote on international laws. That's where I spent most of
my time in the game, writing (and sometimes passing) legislation on things like
[offshore drilling](http://www.nationstates.net/page=WA_past_resolutions/council=1/start=94),
[clean water](http://www.nationstates.net/page=WA_past_resolutions/council=1/start=106),
and [conscientious objection](http://www.nationstates.net/page=WA_past_resolutions/council=1/start=131).
(The last is my favorite. I'd previously submitted it with a title saying it
was about conscientious objection, but it was voted down after a really shitty
FUD-ful debate. I resubmitted almost exactly the same proposal as the Military
Freedom Act, PATRIOT Act-style, and it passed.)

Anyway, Embolalia was the name of my country. I picked it after a few years
playing the game, because I wanted a username that worked as a country name but
could also be used more generally. I thought "speaking without thinking" seemed
somehow apropos to internet commentary. It's now, I think, six years later, and
I haven't played the game in a few years, but the name stuck.

The [flag](/assets/Flag_of_Embolalia.svg) was one I designed for that country,
and I really liked how it came out, so I started using it as an avatar
everywhere.  The country was a federation of three constituent countries (it's
not a rip-off of the UK, because there's only three?).  In-character, the
colors each represented one of the constituent countries, and the star their
union. Really, I yanked the green from the World Assembly and the middle blue
from the late UN (not the real one), since those were where I spent most of my
time in-game. The white-on-blue was a frequent theme in the
[region](http://www.nationstates.net/region=international_democratic_union) I
was in, and I picked the star because it's easy to draw (which is one of the
requirements of a good flag), and plain tricolours are boring. The darker blue
was picked because I couldn't find another color that looked better there.

The similarity to the [Somali flag](/assets/Flag_of_Somalia.svg) was entirely
accidental. Liechtenstein and Haiti used to have *exactly* the same
[flag](/assets/Flag_of_Liechtenstein_and_Haiti.svg), and France, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, and Russia all have red, white, and blue tricolours, though, so
it's not the world's worst case of accidentally similar flags. But, given that
people still assume [Willie](http://willie.dftba.net) was named as a
double-entendre, which I really promise it wasn't, I really ought to be more
careful about these things…
