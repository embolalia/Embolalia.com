Title: About

My name is Edward Powell. I am best known online as Embolalia.

I have a B.S. in Computer and Information Science from [the Ohio State
University](http://osu.edu), which I recieved in May 2013. In my free time, I
enjoy coding in Python, as well as helping to run a small [IRC network](http://dftba.net)
. My biggest project to date is the [Willie](http://willie.dftba.net) IRC bot.
I also have some experience with Java, C++, and other languages.
