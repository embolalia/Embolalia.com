Title: About

My name is Edward Powell. I am best known online as Embolalia.

I am, for not much longer, a student in computer science at [the Ohio State
University](http://osu.edu). I will be graduating in May. In my free time, I
enjoy coding in Python, as well as helping to run a small [IRC network](http://dftba.net)
. My biggest project to date is the [Willie](http://willie.dftba.net) IRC bot.
I also have some experience with Java, C++,
and other languages.
