Title: Contact

I can be contacted through a number of email addresses. I primarily use
`me@(this domain)`. My most common online alias is Embolalia, thus the domain
name, though obviously there are some services where this user is not me
(Twitter being a notable one).

My PGP key fingerprint is
`85B5 ED9B 4356 4FF1 37F5 C1C5 6890 F19A 08B7 9643`. The full key is
available on the 
[MIT Keyserver](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x6890F19A08B79643).
