Title: I am a polynomial

Nobody had ever called me by my real name until college. It's easy to see why;
I didn't have a real name until then. At the time, I didn't even really realize
I was being called by my real name. But by the time I graduated, I realized
that I really much preferred being called by my real name: Embolalia (or Embo,
for short). Bear with me.

Hopefully, you don't need much convincing that Elsie is my real name. You may
be held up on the fact that I was not given that name at birth, or that my
*legal* name is not (yet, as of writing) Elsie.  But does that make it unreal?
Does it make it fake? Is it false, feigned, untrue, imaginary, fraudulent, or
any other antonym of real?

My deadname always felt feigned to me. Even before I realized my real gender
(nobody's questioning my use of "real" *there*, right?), I knew it wasn't my
real name. I tried using the diminuative form, a truncated form, and the full
form. All of them felt off in some way. Whenever I gave that name, it felt
like a lie. When I introduce myself as Elsie, it feels like the truth. That
simple fact makes it my real name.

At some point in college, I started getting involved in OSU's
[Open Source Club](http://opensource.osu.edu). Since (in true FOSS fashion) a
lot of the conversation happens over IRC, it's very normal there to call people
by their screen name. There were more than a few people whose other names I
never actually knew (or did, but only after I was reminded). I had already
started using
[Embolalia](https://embolalia.com/where-the-name-and-flag-came-from.html)
online by then, so that was the name I used (and still use) in the IRC room.

I didn't start out intending that people would call me that in person. It just
sort of happened. I certainly wasn't going to "correct" anyone - not for a name
that wasn't real anyway. I got used to people calling me Embo, and started
introducing myself that way to new club members, and later to some people
outside the club. It acquired that feeling of me-ness that'd always been
missing from my deadname.

When I introduce myself as Embolalia or Embo, it feels honest in exactly the
same way that introducing myself as Elsie does. When someone calls me
Embolalia, it feels like they are referring to my actual self in the same way
it does when they call me Elsie, and the same way it doesn't when they call me
my deadname. If I fuck something up, it feels just as natural to say to myself
"come on, Embo," as it does to say "the fuck, Elsie." It is just as much my
real name to me as Elsie is.

I see no reason why a person can
[only have one real name](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/).
Nor do I see any reason why a name can't be real just because it's used
primarily online.  Identities are complicated, nebulous things. In the same way
that I use a variety of terms to identify my gender, depending on who I'm
talking to or how I'm feeling, I also use a variety of terms to identify
myself. Those terms are equally my name, and are equally real. They are my real
names.
